# React-Confirm Sample Implementations

This repository provides sample implementations for the [react-confirm](https://github.com/haradakunihiko/react-confirm) library using TypeScript and Bootstrap.

Referenced samples are from the original `react-confirm` repository, and these samples are designed to demonstrate:

- **1_typescript**: A basic implementation using TypeScript and Bootstrap.
- **2_typescript_using_context**: An enhanced version of the first sample by integrating React's Context API.

These examples serve as a practical guide for developers to grasp the integration and usage of the `react-confirm` library in their React applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the sample repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/haradakunihiko/react-confirm-sample.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired sample directory (e.g., `1_typescript` or `2_typescript_using_context`):
```
cd [SAMPLE_DIRECTORY]
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

The application should then be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
